# wine-perceptron

* [1/23] The perceptron is written and should train properly. However, the features are set up as column dominate while java is row dominate, needs a rewrite to fix

* [1/29] The perceptron is now row dominate but the IO needs to get rewritten to be more flexible with train/tune/test
